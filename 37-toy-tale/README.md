# Toy Tale Lab Review

## Today's Goals

* Practice the **three pillars** of vanilla JS
* Fetch resources from the backend and render them to the DOM
* Work with event listeners for creating new resources
* Persist new resources to the backend
* Work with event listeners for updating existing resources
* Persist updates to existing resources on the backend
* Manipulate the DOM both pessemistically and optimistically

## Deliverables

1. Render all toys when the DOM loads

* When _the DOM loads_ happens
* I want to make _GET fetch_ request
* Manipulate the DOM _by rendering a toy card for each toy object_

2. Create a new toy and persist it to the DB-

* When _I click the "Create New Toy" button_ happens
* I want to make _a POST fetch request_ request
* Manipulate the DOM _add a new card to the DOM displaying they toy's information_

3. Like a toy

* When _our user clicks the like button_
* We want top _make a PATCH request to the server_
* Manipulate the DOM by _displaying the increased likes number on the DOM_

## Notes

* Optimistic Rendering
  * Manipulating the DOM before communicating to the server
* Pessemistic Rendering
  * Manipulating the DOM with information received from the server
* Callback functions take in function **objects** as their second argument. In order for the function to **wait for the event** before firing, it must be given an object and not a function invocation (e.g. fn())

```javascript
  ‚úÖ myAwesomeElement.addEventListener('click', myFunctionObject)
  ‚ùå myAwesomeElement.addEventListener('click', myFunctionInvocation())
```

* You callback function takes in the event object as a default parameter. If you want to pass in **anything else**, you will need to **wrap** that callback function in a funcion object. See below:

```javascript
  ‚úÖ myAwesomeElement.addEventListener('submit', () => myCallbackFunction(argument1, argument2, argument3))
  ‚úÖ myAwesomeElement.addEventListener('submit', function() {
        myCallbackFunction(argument1, argument2, argument3)
     })
  // Note: the callback function does not HAVE to accept the event in it's parameter if it is not being used
  ‚ùå myAwesomeElement.addEventListener('click', myFunctionInvocation(argument1, argument2))
  // This will invoke the function, so it will NOT wait for the event before firing. Additionally, arguement1 is actually the event object since that is what gets passed into the callback function as the first parameter!! üò±
```

You've got a friend in need! Your friend Andy recently misplaced all their toys!
Help Andy recover their toys and get the toys back in the toy collection.

## Create Your Server

All of the toy data is stored in the `db.json` file. You'll want to access this
data using a JSON server. In order to do this, run the following two commands:

   * `npm install -g json-server`
   * `json-server --watch db.json`
   
This will create a server storing all of our lost toy data with restful routes
at `http://localhost:3000/toys`. You can also check out
`http://localhost:3000/toys/:id`

## Fetch Andy's Toys

On the `index.html` page, there is a `div` with the `id` "toy-collection."

When the page loads, make a 'GET' request to fetch all the toy objects. With the
response data, make a `<div class="card">` for each toy and add it to the
toy-collection `div`.

## Add Toy Info to the Card

Each card should have the following child elements:

  * `h2` tag with the toy's name
  * `img` tag with the `src` of the toy's image attribute and the class name "toy-avatar"
  * `p` tag with how many likes that toy has
  * `button` tag with a class "like-btn"

After all of that, the toy card should resemble:

```html
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Woody</h2>
    <img src=toy_image_url class="toy-avatar" />
    <p>4 Likes </p>
    <button class="like-btn">Like <3</button>
  </div>
```

## Add a New Toy

* When a user clicks on the add new toy button, a `POST` request is sent to `http://localhost:3000/toys` and the new toy is added to Andy's Toy Collection.
* The toy should conditionally render to the page.
* In order to send a POST request via Fetch, give the Fetch a second argument of an object. This object should specify the method as `POST` and also provide the appropriate headers and the JSON-ified data for the request. If your request isn't working, make sure your header and keys match the documentation.

```
POST http://localhost:3000/toys
headers: 
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  Accept: "application/json"
}

body: JSON.stringify({
  "name": "Jessie",
  "image": "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/p__/images/8/88/Jessie_Toy_Story_3.png/revision/latest?cb=20161023024601&path-prefix=protagonist",
  "likes": 0
})
```

* For examples, refer to the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#Supplying_request_options).

## Increase Toy's Likes

When a user clicks on a toy's like button, two things should happen:

  * Conditional increase to the toy's like count
  * A patch request sent to the server at `http://localhost:3000/toys/:id` updating the number of likes that the specific toy has
  * Headers and body are provided below (If your request isn't working, make sure your header and keys match the documentation.)
  
```
PATCH http://localhost:3000/toys/:id
headers: 
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  Accept: "application/json"
}

body: JSON.stringify({
  "likes": <new number>
})
```
