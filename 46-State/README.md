## Imperative Programming
- Explicitly tell your program every step it needs to execute
- In vanilla JS, find the relevant DOM elements
- Programmatically create, update, or remove DOM elements

## Declarative Programming
- Tells the program 'what' the webpage should be/should look like
- The 'how' is abstracted

## State
- Represents things that change about the DOM
- State is similar to props, but it is private and fully managed by the class component (can't be functional)
- is an object

## Where to Put State?
- Single Source of truth
	- A comment ancestor between all components that 'touch' on this state
	- data can only flow from parent to child, not sibling components
- Set up the state object using this.state in the constructor
	- or outside the constructor

## Conditional Rendering

## Informational Flow
- Parent communicates to child by passing props

- How does child communicate with parent?
	- State Changing Callback!!
- Don't modify state directly, use this.setState({})
  - works asynchronously

## Virtual DOM
- When does the DOM get re-rendered?





#### When <some event> happens?
- I want to change the DOM by manipulating state
 - and state changes will propagate as props to update all components
