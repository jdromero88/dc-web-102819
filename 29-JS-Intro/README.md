## Intro to Javascript
- Invented to compete with native Desktop applications
- HTML, CSS, and JS (behavior)
- The index.html file MUST contain a script tag reference to the script.js file

### Learning a New Programming language
- How to Debug (console.log(), alert(), debugger)
- Documentation [MDN]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/))

### Difference between Ruby and JS
- data type number
- assign variables using var, let, const
- "undefined" NaN
- functions can be written so many ways
- return MUST be explicit (JS is more syntactially strict)
- arguments, too few or too many arguments, JS don't care  
- type coercion

### Datatypes
- What types and how many?

#### Primitive
X number
X boolean
X string
    - interpolate `${}`
    - concatenation +
- undefined
- null

#### Objects
- objects
- arrays
- functions

### Pass by Value versus Pass by Reference
























### Functions as Objects
- all the difference ways to write functions
- hoisting
