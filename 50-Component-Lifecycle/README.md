# React Component Lifecycle
- For class components that extend React.Component
- can't use them with functional components

## Available Methods
- http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/
- https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html

## Task Lister
- Walk through

## Lifecycle Methods only for class components

- When form is submitted,
 make POST fetch,
then update state of tasks (that is going to cause REACT to re-render the DOM)
- When "X" is clicked, I want to make a DELETE fetch, then update the state of TASKS in App

### Creation
- `componentDidMount()`
 - fetch
 - add extra event listeners
 - set up timers
 - things that require the DOM

#### Setting Initial State using Props

### Update
- `render()`
 - has a return value
 - don't update state here
- `componentDidUpdate()`
 - fetch maybe?

### Deletion
 - `componentWillUnmount()`
  - called right before element is removed from DOM
  - clean up things from componentDidMount

#### Where to put fetch?
- ComponentDidMount
- ComponentDidUpdate
- Event handlers

### React Hooks?

### Less used methods
- `shouldComponentUpdate()`
- `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
- `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`

### Deprecated Methods
- `componentWillMount()`
- `componentWillReceiveProps()`
- `componentWillUpdate()`
